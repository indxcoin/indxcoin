What is Indxcoin?
----------------

Indxcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Indxcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Indxcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

Indxcoin utilizes the mPOSV algorithm for its consensus mechanism. mPOSV stands for Modified Proof-of-Stake Velocity. This algorithm combines the traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Stake Velocity (PoSV) consensus protocols.

Unlike traditional PoS systems, mPOSV requires a minimum of 10,000 coins to be held in order to stake a block. This is done to ensure that the network is secure and resistant to malicious attacks. Furthermore, there is a minimum staking age of three days and a maximum staking age of twelve days.

In mPOSV, the staking rewards are no longer based on the coin weight, but rather the transaction fees associated with the block. This ensures that miners are incentivized to process transactions quickly and securely.

Overall, Indxcoin's mPOSV algorithm is designed to be secure, encourage participation, and provide incentives for miners to process transactions quickly.
